		  <h1> Welcome to my online programming and GIS portfolio</h1>
            <div>
                <p class="introduction">I am currently studying for a master's in Geographical Information Systems at the University of Leeds after having obtained a BSc
            in Environmental Science at the University of Plymouth. As part of my programming module for my MSc I have created an agent based model in Python 3 based on the practical work completed during lectures and for the module final project will be creating an application that combines maps of the UK in a Jupyter Notebook. As this website is updated I will be adding examples of work I have done in GIS software packages such as ArcGIS, MapInfo and QGIS as well as showcasing work completed in R and Tableau. For more detailed information about me please see my "about me" page.
