                <h1>ABOUT THIS SITE</h1>
                    <div>
                        <p class="aboutsiteP">This site was created by basing the CSS and some of the HTML from a template sourced from <a href="http://templated.co" class="aboutsitelink" target="_blank">templated.co</a>. This site provides a large collection of templates which they have very helpfully released under the creative commons (license details can be seen <a href="license.html" class="aboutsitelink" target="_blank">here</a>)To create this site I used elements of their CSS templates and some of their HTML template to create the look I was going for. In the future I aim to completely hand code the website myself and neaten up my HTML and CSS. If you right click on the page and choose <i>view page source</i> you will see my code and where I have commented code that was taken from the template. If you like the style and wish to see the souce material it is known as <a href="https://templated.co/adequately" class="aboutsitelink" target="_blank">adequately</a> on the <a href="http://templated.co" class="aboutsitelink" target="_blank">templated.co</a> webpage.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p class="aboutsiteP">Another very useful resource I used to help me code this website was <a href="http://www.w3schools.com" class="aboutsitelink" target="_blank">w3schools.com</a> whose website gives good and indepth advice on HTML and CSS coding elements and syntax and provides examples for the user to try themselves. Without this website as a reference guide I would not have been able to build the site you see today, even with the use of a template. They also provide information on useing other languages such as javascript so I would reccomend this site to any budding web page builders. I can say for certain that further updates to this site will be made by heavily referencing <a href="http://www.w3schools.com" class="aboutsitelink" target="_blank">w3schools.com</a>.</p>
