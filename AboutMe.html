                        <p class="Paboutme">After leaving college at 18 years old I made the decison to not go to university as I was unsure what career path I wanted to take and did not wish to waste time and money on a course that would not lead to a future fulfilling career. I ended up working in a variety of jobs from retail and bar work to call centre and general admin work. None of these jobs appealed to me enough to want to make a career in, and having become more aware of the importance of being scientifically literate and the issues related to climate change and environmental pressures I then made the jump to University to start an undergradute degree in Environmental Science at the University of Plymouth. </p>

                    <div>
                        <p class="Paboutme">Before starting my undergradute degree I completed the University of Plymouth's <a href="https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/courses/undergraduate/bsc-extended-science-2" class="aboutsitelink" target="_blank">Extended Science</a> course, which in 2012 took place at the main university campus rather than at South Devon College. This year provided me the essentials to be able to confidently complete a 3 year science undergradute course which I managed to do with a First class honours. It was while studying for my Environmental Science course that I was introduced to Geographical Information Systems (GIS). I very quickly saw the benefits of learning about GIS which led to me undertaking a successful placement year at the United kingdom Hydrographic Office working in their Thematics team. As graduation approached I felt that so far I had barely scratched the surface of GIS software so to make myself more employable and to learn more about GIS I decided to embark on a Masters course at the University of Leeds.</p>
