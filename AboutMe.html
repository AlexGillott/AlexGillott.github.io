                    <div>
                        <p class="Paboutme">After leaving college at 18 years old I made the decision to not go to university as I was unsure what career path I wanted to take and did not wish to waste time and money on a course that would not lead to a future fulfilling career. I ended up working in a variety of jobs from retail and bar work to call centre and general admin work. None of these jobs appealed to me enough to want to make a career in, and having become more aware of the importance of being scientifically literate and the issues related to climate change and environmental pressures I then made the jump to University to start an undergraduate degree in Environmental Science at the University of Plymouth.</p>

                    <h2 class="h2aboutme">Environmental Science at the University of Plymouth (BSc):</h2>    
                    <div>
                        <p class="Paboutme">Before starting my undergraduate degree I completed the University of Plymouth's <a href="https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/courses/undergraduate/bsc-extended-science-2" class="aboutsitelink" target="_blank">Extended Science</a> course, which in 2012 took place at the main university campus rather than at South Devon College. This year provided me the essentials to be able to confidently complete a 3-year science undergraduate course which I managed to do with a First class honours. It was while studying for my Environmental Science course that I was introduced to Geographical Information Systems (GIS). I very quickly saw the benefits of learning about GIS which led to me undertaking a successful placement year at the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office working in their Thematics team. As graduation approached I felt that I had barely scratched the surface of GIS software so to make myself more employable and to learn more about GIS I decided to embark on a Masters course at the University of Leeds.</p>

                    <h2 class="h2aboutme">Geographical Information Systems (GIS) at the University of Leeds (MSc):</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p class="Paboutme">I have just finished my first semester studying GIS at the University of Leeds where my modules included Data Visualisation and Analysis, Professional and Personal Development (PPD) and Programming for Geographical Information Analysis: Core Skills.</p>
                        <p class="Paboutme">The Data Visualisation and Analysis module included work on spatial data and analysis, data classification, accessibility and networks, Raster analysis, multi-criteria evaluation, interpolation and spatial clustering. The PPD module involved CV and career advice and learning about other software packages. These were R studio and Tableau, MapInfo and QGIS. The programming module involved learning about the basics of Python 3 (e.g. variables, containers, functions and classes etc.), with a practical portfolio consisting of an Agent Based Model (see github code here) and an independent project I am currently working on</p>
                        <p class="Paboutme">My second semester modules are GIS and Environment, Digital Image Processing and Web-based GIS as well as a dissertation project to be completed over the summer. The GIS and Environment module will involve looking at how GIS can be used to study environmental sciences and will include modelling terrain, hydrology, ecology and land use. The Digital Imaging Processing module will involve learning about the theory behind remote observation and using software to read, display, restore, classify and extract information from remotely sensed images. The Web-based GIS module will involve being taught the principles of web-based GIS such as an understanding of client and server-side technologies and setting up a working custom GIS-based web client and server.</p>
